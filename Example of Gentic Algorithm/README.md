# Smart-Boxes_Python-AI
Smart Boxes, Python/Pygame AI Project with Genetic Algorithm
by Burak Unutmaz

INTRODUCTION

* This is my first swing at the Genetic Algorithm,
* In this project, each generation has 200 (variable) smart boxes, that try to reach the end goal.
* Smart boxes are controlled by a DNA object and that object has a list of forces that apply on the boxes.
* Boxes change velocity with each force applied and the best ones get a bigger palce in the gene pool.
* New boxes are selected from the gene pool and it continues until the level is complete.
* At the start of each level, the "knowledge" of each box is cleared, for a new start.

REQUIREMENTS:
  * Python 3.x
  * Pygame
